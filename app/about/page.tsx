                  Aftab leads Frontis Tech with a simple operating philosophy:
                  understand what a business needs, be straight about whether we
                  can help, and then make it happen. His background spans
                  information technology and business operations, built on an
                  engineering foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a founder-operator, he has built and run the kind of delivery
                  teams Frontis Tech now provides to its clients, which means the
                  company is run by someone who has done the work, not just sold
                  it. He is a familiar face at the industry&rsquo;s key events,
                  including Medicarians, LeadsCon, and Collision.

                Growth-focused businesses rarely have one problem. The company that
                needs more qualified sales conversations usually also needs help with
                the CRM those conversations land in, the staff to follow them up, the
                marketing that feeds them, and the software that ties it all together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The traditional answer is five vendors, five contracts, and five
                versions of the truth, with the client stuck in the middle doing the
                coordination. Frontis Tech was founded to replace that arrangement
                with a single operations partner that scales across calling,
                back-office, staffing, marketing, and software.
              </p>
              <p>
                One partner, one point of accountability, and connections that
                convert.
